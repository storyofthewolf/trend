[land model variables go here]

# 1st line is the variables to be read form .cam.h0.
# 2nd line is the variables to be read from cice.h
# 3rd line is the variables to be read from clm.h0
# string types separated by spaces
# lon, lat, lev, time are implicitly included and always read
# 
# only 2D variables are supported.  Easily can add 3d functioning, but would
# either need to check the variable list and reorded into [2D,3D], or simply
# make a seperate list here.  (i.e. 1st line is cam.h0 2D, 2nd line is cam.h0 3D

# First block describes the variables read from netcdf
# Second block sets the variables to write to screen
# Third block sets the variavles to plot
#     within each block...
# 1st line is the variables to be read form cam.h0
# 2nd line is the variables to be read from cice.h
# 3rd line is the variables to be read from clm.h0
# string types separated by spaces
# lon, lat, lev, time are implicitly included and always read
# 
# As of June 1, 2023. only 2D variables are supported. Most quantities of
# interest are 2D (surface temperature, TOA energy balance, etc). I will 
# eventually add option for read in full 3D variables when the utility of ush
# is requested or becomes self-evident.
